Notes is a whack-a-mole style game created for an intro game development class. My twist on the game is that the music is procedurally generated based on the gameplay. Each time a player hits a note it triggers a random sound that fits in with the background music. The game was built with Flash and AS3. You can play the game on [Newgrounds.com](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/612467).

This was my first game that I ever made. Looking back on it I did some really dumb things programming wise but I'm actually pretty happy with how the art and music turned out. The polish on the game is surprisingly high for my first game.
