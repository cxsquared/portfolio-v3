The Chore is a game built with [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com) in the 72 hour [Ludume Dare Jam](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=23711). I handled the programming and audio for the game and the art was done by [@Moussetticus](https://twitter.com/Moussetticus). The theme for this jam was One Room and we created a sequence puzzle game about cleaning a room. Though the story of the game follows a darker path. You can look at the source code of the game on my [Github](https://github.com/cxsquared/LD37).

You've got one job today and that's to clean up the house. Hopefully you can do it before you significant other get's home. This choir might just test the relationship.

Click on objects to clean up the house. Make sure you don't make a mess of something you've already cleaned.

If you are interested you can read the postmortem about the game [here](/blog/the-chore-ld37-postmortem/)!
