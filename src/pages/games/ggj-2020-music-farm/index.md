Your flower farm has been destroyed but you mysteriously received a package of new seeds. Plant the flowers and sprinklers to create music. WASD: Move Q/E: Select Flower Space: Plant Made by [@cxsquared](https://twitter.com/cxsquared) and [@meanderingleaf](https://twitter.com/meanderingleaf) and James "Shamus" Haines. Thanks to Lacey for the name.
