So it&#8217;s less than a week before this year&#8217;s Game Developers Conference (GDC) and I can&#8217;t hold in my excitement. This will be my first time attending GDC, and I couldn&#8217;t begin to describe how terribly excited I am. Getting the chance to step my foot into the video game industry is beyond amazing. I&#8217;ve already stumbled uponÂ so many wondrous talks and parties that could last a month let alone be shoved into a week. It&#8217;s overwhelming and perfect and I&#8217;m counting down everyday till it arrives.

To top off the experience of just going to GDC I was lucky enough to be chosen as a Conference Associate. This means that I don&#8217;t only get to see GDC and all it has to offer, but I also get to work and get paid to help with GDC. I will be one of many that are responsible for making sure all the activities at GDC go off without a hitch. With this opportunity I&#8217;ll get to meet some of the people that make the game industry such an amazing place. To me, it is an honor to be granted the experience of being a Conference Associate.

The time is drawing near when I will take flight and be headed to San Francisco. Days are passing by and counting down and they still aren&#8217;t moving fast enough. As I&#8217;m writing this I can&#8217;t help but think that this time next week I&#8217;ll be on a plane heading to the biggest get together of the video game industry. It&#8217;s a moment that I won&#8217;t forget and a time that I won&#8217;t put to waste. I hope to use this experience to take my first step to a career doing what I love.

I&#8217;ll leave this post with the design of my first business cards that I&#8217;ll be using heavily during GDC.

If you are going to be at GDC make sure to leave a comment and hopefully we&#8217;ll run into each other!
