Space Cowboy Shooting Gallery is an alternative controller shooting gallery game built with [Unity](http://unity3d.com/5?gclid=CKnDzaXg4MMCFQqDaQodi7QAXQ) and the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/). The game was built during a 24 hour game jam at IUPUI. I was the programmer for the game and created it along with [Michael Auer](https://twitter.com/auermi) and Luke Brown. We wanted to use something different during the game jam and our school had a Leap Motion so we decided to use it. You can see the source code and download the game over on my [Github](https://github.com/cxsquared/SpaceCowboyShootingGallery).

The biggest challenge in creating this game was using the Leap Motion. I had never used it before but the API they had for Unity was fairly easy to use. Getting simple gestures and movement worked out really well to create a nice simple game.
