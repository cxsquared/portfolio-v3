Down the Rabbit Hole is a standard platformer built with [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com/) in 48 hours for [Ludum Dare 31](http://ludumdare.com/compo/). This was my first Ludum Dare and my goal was to finish a game and place in the top 100 for audio. I'm proud to say I accomplished these goals. You can play the game either by clicking read more or over on the [Ludum Dare website](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=23711). You can also checkout my source code over on my [Github](https://github.com/cxsquared/LD_OneScreen).

The theme for this Ludum Dare was Entire Game on One Screen. My idea was to have each of my levels be built from the tiles of the last so it appeared that you where falling from each level into the next. The art work for my level wasn't great but I was happy with the mood it created.

My biggest accomplishment was the soundtrack and the little sound design work I did. I added a few variants of a falling sound when you hit the ground at a certain speed. This really gave a heavier more realistic feel to the controls.

Here's how the game did.
